## Android EcoA10 Getting Started
An Android sample project to test the [EcoA10 library](https://github.com/ecopaynet/ecoa10-library-android).

## Introduction

EcoA10 communicates with Bluetooth and Serial Port payment terminals. This terminals are robust and secure, certified to make card payments using the following input methodes: contactless, NFC, chip, magnetic stripe and manual input.

Integrated on the Android project, the EcoA10 generates this most important entry points:
 - Initialization of EcoA10

 - Android minimum SDK version 15 (4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich).
 - Internet connectivity (GPRS, Wifi, Ethernet...).
 - Bluetooth capabilities (if communicate with bluetooth terminals is needed).
 - USB Host port (if communicate with serial port terminals is needed). USB OTG dongle also can be used.

EcoA10 and the "Getting Started" project are made with Android Studio.

## Getting Started project
This project is made to demonstrate the simplicity of the EcoA10 library integration onto your Android project. There are some other functions to complete a full working demostration of the EcoA10.
